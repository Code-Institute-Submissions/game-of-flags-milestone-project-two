# [GAME OF FLAGS](https://takaforyannick30.github.io/game-of-flags-milestone-project-two/) - Milestone Project Two

## About

The Game Of Flags application is a simple replica of a classical memory card game. The aim of the game is to match all pairs of flags before the time runs out. It requires observation, concentration, and a good memory to win. The game is also known as Concentration, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso, and Pairs. You can find out more about the concentration game by visiting the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)) page and the rules of a classical table card game [here](https://www.classicgamesandpuzzles.com/Memory.html).

I created this game to serve the purpose of my Interactive Frontend Development Project. The project scope was to create the game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with the main focus being the functional logic created with Javascript. The name of this application was inspired by two things; firstly, my love for Game of Thrones and secondly, the choice of images for the project.

## UX

## Features

### Functionality
* The game starts with an overlay containing a "play" button which starts the game when clicked.  
* The pointer changes to a hand when hovered over the cards and overlays.  
* The cards increase in size when hovered over.
* When a card is flipped the player hears a flip sound.* Matches made are counted all through the game. * Time countdown - the user has 60 seconds to match all cards.  
* "Victory" overlay appears when the player matches all cards within 60seconds with a "play-again" button which takes the user back to the home page.
* "Game Over" overlay appears when the player fails to match all cards within 60 seconds.
* All cards can't be seen at the same time. If a player clicks on one card, it stays flipped. When clicking on a second card it flips and both cards then turn back if it is not a match.  
*The game reloads when a player clicks on "Reset", "Play Again" and "Try Again" * Background sound starts playing as soon as the game starts. The player also hears sounds when a match is made, when game is won and when game is lost.

### Existing features

* **Game Intro overlay**
* **Mute and Unmute button** for background music
* **Cards**
* **Timer**
* **match counter**
* **Victory overlay**
* **Game Over overlay**

### Features Left To Implement

* Add more game levels. At the moment the game has just one level but in the nearest future I would love to add more game levels to make the game more interesting.
* Add a Pause button. I would like to add a pause button which allows users to pause the game.
* Add a Leaderboard. In the nearest future when I learn Python, I would like to implement a highscore leaderboard for players.

##  Testing

## Deployment

This project has been deployed to Github Pages from the master branch. A link to the deployed version of the site can be found [here]( https://takaforyannick30.github.io/game-of-flags-milestone-project-two/).

This site was developed using Gitpod. All changes to the code were then added and committed to a local repository. The commits were then pushed to my GitHub repository.The process can be seen as bellow;

`git add (add file name)`

`git commit -m (add a commit mesage)` with "initial commit" always serving as the first commit message to a new repository.

`git push` 

 The project was hosted using GitHub pages directly from the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html. The process of deploying this project on GitHub pages can be seen as bellow; 

* Go to the settings tab of the repository, and scroll down to GitHub pages.

* Under GitHub pages, click on "source" and select the master branch.

* You will be automatically taken to the top of the page wherein a light blue bar will be stated: "GitHub pages source saved".

* Scroll down to GitHub pages where will be stated "your site is ready to be published at "[ https://takaforyannick30.github.io/game-of-flags-milestone-project-two/]( https://takaforyannick30.github.io/game-of-flags-milestone-project-two/)".

* Click on the URL and you will be auto-referred to the published webpage. When returning to the GitHub repository setting, scroll down to GitHub pages and you will see a light green block stating "Your site is published at " [ https://takaforyannick30.github.io/game-of-flags-milestone-project-two/]( https://takaforyannick30.github.io/game-of-flags-milestone-project-two/)".

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone   https://takaforyannick30.github.io/game-of-flags-milestone-project-two.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.

You can submit a pull request to the master branch and await approval. To do this:

* Navigate to the [original repository]( https://takaforyannick30.github.io/game-of-flags-milestone-project-two)

* Click on **New pull request** on the right of the Branch menu

* On the compare page, click **compare across forks**

* Confirm that the base fork is the repository you'd like to merge into

* Use the head fork drop-down menu to select your fork,then use the compare branch drop-down menu to select the branch you made your changes in* Type a little description for your pull request

* If you do not want to allow anyone with push access to the upstream repository to make changes to your PR, unselect **Allow edits from maintainers**

* Click **Create pull request**
