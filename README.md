## About

The Game Of Flags application is a simple replica of a classical memory card game. The aim of the game is to match all pairs of flags before the time runs out. It requires observation, concentration, and a good memory to win. The game is also known as Concentration, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso, and Pairs. You can find out more about the concentration game by visiting the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)) page and the rules of a classical table card game [here](https://www.classicgamesandpuzzles.com/Memory.html).

I created this game to serve the purpose of my Interactive Frontend Development Project. The project scope was to create the game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with the main focus being the functional logic created with Javascript. The name of this application was inspired by two things; firstly, my love for Game of Thrones and secondly, the choice of images for the project.
